Airnodes are first-party oracles that are directly operated by the API Providers that provide data to any on-chain dApp. The Smart Contracts can request data from the Airnodes without going through any intermediary.

The API3 QRNG service is implemented using the Airnode request–response protocol contract AirnodeRrpV0➚ (by way of RrpRequesterV0.sol➚) to acquire a random number.
